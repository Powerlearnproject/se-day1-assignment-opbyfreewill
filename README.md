Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall Methodology - The Waterfall model is a linear, sequential approach where each phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is completed before moving to the next. 
Agile Methodology - Agile is an iterative and incremental approach that focuses on delivering small, functional increments of software quickly. It emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and customer feedback. Popular Agile frameworks include Scrum and Kanban.

Waterfall follows a linear and sequential approach, while Agile is iterative and incremental, allowing for continuous improvements.
Waterfall is rigid, making changes difficult to implement, whereas Agile is flexible, easily adapting to changing requirements.
Customer involvement in Waterfall is limited, mostly occurring at the beginning and end, whereas Agile ensures continuous engagement, incorporating frequent feedback.
Waterfall relies on extensive and detailed documentation, while Agile prioritizes minimal documentation, focusing more on delivering working software.
Testing in Waterfall happens after implementation, making defect detection slower, while Agile integrates testing throughout the process, ensuring early issue resolution.
Waterfall follows a fixed and predictable timeline, whereas Agile operates on a variable timeline, adjusting based on iterations.
Waterfall is best suited for projects with clear and unchanging requirements, while Agile is ideal for projects with evolving or uncertain requirements.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Example of a Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about cars."

Why It’s Vague:
The prompt is overly broad and lacks specificity.

It does not provide context or direction, so the AI may generate irrelevant or overly general information.

The output could range from car history to manufacturing processes, which may not align with the user's intent.

Improved Prompt:
"Explain the key differences between electric cars and internal combustion engine (ICE) cars in terms of environmental impact, cost of ownership, and performance."

Why It’s Effective:
Clear and Specific: The prompt narrows the focus to a specific comparison (electric vs. ICE cars) and identifies three key areas (environmental impact, cost of ownership, and performance).

Concise: It is straightforward and avoids unnecessary complexity.

Actionable: The AI can generate a structured and relevant response that directly addresses the user's query.

Contextual: It provides enough context for the AI to deliver a meaningful and targeted answer.

Explanation of Effectiveness:
The improved prompt ensures the AI understands the exact information needed, reducing the likelihood of irrelevant or overly broad responses.

It guides the AI to focus on specific aspects (environmental impact, cost, and performance), making the output more useful and actionable for the user.

By being concise and clear, it saves time for both the user and the AI, leading to a more efficient interaction.
